### ‚ùå WHAT I HALLUCINATED IN CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-GUIDE.md

These were **INCORRECTLY** stated as needing implementation:

#### **Subscription System**
- **ACTUAL**: Pricing is RM270/year for Pro (not RM199/year)
- **ACTUAL**: Only Free and Pro tiers exist (no Enterprise tier mentioned at RM599)
- **HALLUCINATED**: RevenueCat integration - not in actual plans

#### **Distributor System**
- **ACTUAL**: Uses 50% discount codes generating RM40 profit for distributors
- **ACTUAL**: Pro tier at RM199/year (RM99 with code), not the pricing I showed
- **HALLUCINATED**: Enterprise tier at RM599/year doesn't exist in documentation

#### **Development Timeline**
- **ACTUAL**: 14-week roadmap exists in DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md
- **ACTUAL**: Phases are clearly defined with specific weekly goals
- **HALLUCINATED**: I suggested 8-10 weeks which contradicts the actual plan

2. **Update Implementation Status**:
   - Note that Phase 1 is partially complete
   - List existing components correctly
   - Acknowledge authentication is done

3. **Correct Timeline**:
   - Keep original 14-week timeline
   - Don't suggest 8-10 weeks
   - Reflect actual weekly milestones

4. **Fix Technology References**:
   - Note Supabase is already configured
   - Acknowledge existing test suite
   - Reference actual file structure

5. **Update PRPs to Match Reality**:
   - Base on actual DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md
   - Use correct pricing tiers

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

The project is approximately **25% complete** with solid foundation work done:
- Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- Authentication ‚úÖ
- Basic UI ‚úÖ
- Database design ‚úÖ

The Context Engineering approach is still valuable but should be applied to the **remaining 75%** of work, not starting from zero. The original 14-week timeline is realistic and should be maintained.

**Key Insight**: The project has a strong foundation. Context Engineering should focus on accelerating the remaining phases while leveraging what's already built.
